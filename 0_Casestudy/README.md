# Case study-1

# Gas Leakage detector

## components required
1.Microcontroller
* A microcontroller is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system.

2.LCD
* The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive range of applications like various circuits & devices.

3.Gas sensor
* Gas sensors (also known as gas detectors) are electronic devices that detect and identify different types of gasses. They are commonly used to detect toxic or explosive gasses and measure gas concentration.

4.Potentiometer
* Potentiometer are used in the circuit to control the threshold value of the gas.

5.Transformer
* Here transformers are used to provide power supply to the circuit.

6.Buzzer
* Buzzer is a kind of voice device that converts audio model into sound signal. It is mainly used to prompt or alarm.

* Buzzer is a kind of voice device that converts audio model into sound signal. It is mainly used to prompt or alarm. 

4.Relay
* A relay is an electrically operated switch. It is used to control the water pump used in the design.

5.Ultrasonic Sensor 
* An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.

# Requirements

## High level requirements
* Use of ultrasonic sensor must be done in the project.
* Use of LCD display.
* We have used buzzer.
* Relay is used here.
 

## low level requirements
* Here using ultrasonic sensor we can calculate the depth of the tank i.e how much water is yet to be filled.
* By using LCD display we can keep a track of water level without actually measuring the depth.
* Buzzer is actually used to tell the user that the tank is full and it should be switched off.
* Here relay is a power driving component and it is used to control the pumping of water.
