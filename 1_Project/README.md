# Security system using Ultrasonic sensor


## Abstarct



## Requirements

### High level requirements
* Use of ultrasonic sensor must be done in the project.
* Use of LCD display.
* Use of servo motor.


## low level requirements
*  Here using ultrasonic sensor we can calculate the exact distance between the objects.
* By using LCD display we can keep a track of water level without actually measuring the depth.
* 


## Components required
1.Arduino Uno
* A arduino uno is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system.

2.LCD
* The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive range of applications like various circuits & devices.

3.Ultrasonic Sensor 
* An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.

4.Potentiometer
* Potentiometer are used in the circuit to control the threshold value of the gas.

5.Servo motor
* A servomotor is a linear actuator or rotary actuator that allows for precise control of linear or angular position, acceleration, and velocity.
