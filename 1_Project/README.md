# Distance Calculating System Using Ultrasonic Sensor


## Abstarct
In the old times calculating distance was much difficult. But today it has become so easy by using the modern technique which involves many kind of sensor,actuators etc.A servo motor is also known for its rotation with great precision. And what would be better than giving that precise distance/rotation using an ultrasonic sensor. This project uses a servo motor and an LCD screen with an ultrasonic sensor. The distance of the object from the sensor is mapped with the rotation of the motor between 0 and 180 degrees. So, when the object is at a distance of 30cm, the servo angle is 30 degrees and when the object is at a distance of 90 cm, the servo angle is 90 degrees, and so on.


## Components required
1.Arduino Uno
* A arduino uno is a compact integrated circuit designed to govern a specific operation in an embedded system.

2.LCD
* The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive range of applications like various circuits & devices.

3.Ultrasonic Sensor 
* An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal.

4.Potentiometer
* Potentiometer are used in the circuit to control the threshold value of the gas.

5.Servo motor
* A servomotor is a linear actuator or rotary actuator that allows for precise control of linear or angular position, acceleration, and velocity.
