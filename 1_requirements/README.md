# Requirements

## High level requirements
* Use of ultrasonic sensor must be done in the project.
* Use of LCD display.
* We have used buzzer.
* Relay is used here.
 

## low level requirements
* Here using ultrasonic sensor we can calculate the depth of the tank i.e how much water is yet to be filled.
* By using LCD display we can keep a track of water level without actually measuring the depth.
* Buzzer is actually used to tell the user that the tank is full and it should be switched off.
* Here relay is a power driving component and it is used to control the pumping of water.
